This project focuses on how to connect RTL kernels and C kernels (AXI-Stream) in Vitis 2022.2

  **Step 1:**

  Refer to `RTL_Kernel_Creation` directory. 
  
  Here are the files and required to create our own RTL kernel via both Vitis and Vivado.

  **Step 2:**

  Refer to `Vitis` directory. 

  The directory contains the project setup, including the host application, two C kernels, and the RTL kernel(.xo) generated in Step 1.
